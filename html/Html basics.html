    <p>Sri Lanka documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human settlements that dates to at least 125,000 years ago. 
        It has a rich cultural heritage. The earliest known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, known collectively as the PƒÅli canon, date to the fourth 
        Buddhist council, which took place in 29 BCE. Sri Lanka's geographic location and deep harbours have made it of great strategic importance, 
        from the earliest days of the ancient Silk Road trade route to today's so-called maritime Silk Road</p> 
        <hr>
    <p> Because its location made it a major trading hub, it was already known to both Far Easterners and Europeans as long ago as the Anuradhapura period. 
        The country's trade in luxury goods and spices attracted traders of many nations, which helped to create Sri Lanka's diverse population. 
        During a period of great political crisis in the Sinhalese kingdom of Kotte, the Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka (largely by accident) and 
        then sought to control the island's maritime regions and its lucrative external trade.</p>
