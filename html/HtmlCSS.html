        <h1>NSBM Green University</h1>
        <p>NSBM prides itself on being a forward-thinking entity, with the constant drive to push boundaries. Thus, it moves onto 
            Phase II of NSBM Green University acquiring more land in Pitipana, Homagama to deliver greater opportunities to its 
            potential multitudes of students.
            Along with the new infrastructure, the Faculty of Science, Faculty of Humanity, and Faculty of Law will be added to 
            offer new academic programs to cater to the current trends in academia and its respective industry.
            Adding on another 15 acres to NSBM's Phase 1 of 25 acres of sprawling space for its students, the new addition would 
            encompass more amenities and facilities to house local and international students including, extended Car Parking facilities, 
            Hostel facilities for over 1,000 students to ensure easy access and comfort, Multipurpose Conference Hall with over 1,500 
            seating capacity, a large Playground and scenic Walking paths surrounded by a Natural lake.

         <h3>Asia</h3>
         <p class="asia">Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. 
             The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation 
             between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity.</p>
        
        <h3>Europe</h3>
        <p class="europe">Europe covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it 
            the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, 
            of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population.</p>
